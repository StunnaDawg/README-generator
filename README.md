# README-generator

## Description     
This project is a command line application that generates a README template through various prompts from the user. My motivation for this application was so I can easily create README.md template for my various projects in a quick and efficient way. This application solves the problem of always having to create the same template for my projects all the time. During the process of buidling this application, I learned how to utlize different functions with the inquirer package, I also got more comfortable with using 'fswrite' to handle the template generation.
