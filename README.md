This project is a command line application that generates a README template through various prompts from the user. My motivation for this application was so I can easily create README.md template for my various projects in a quick and efficien way. This application solves the problem of always having to create the same template for my projects all the time. During this the creatio of this project I learned how to utlize different functions with the inquirer package also I figured learned how to use 'fswrite' so I could create a README and add the anwsers to yhe prompts
